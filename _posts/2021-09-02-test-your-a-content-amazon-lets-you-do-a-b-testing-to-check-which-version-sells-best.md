Did you know you can do A/B testing on your Amazon A+ content?

It's an easy way for you to find out what formats work best for your enhanced
listings content.

### What is A+ content?

A+, also called Enhanced Brand Content, is the enriched content with pictures
and more text ‘below the fold’.

On mobile, depending on the category, it can be displayed below the product
picture, even before the bullet points – so it's important.

At e-Comas we’ve tested A+ on many products in different categories, and found
it can boost your sales by 5-10%.

It's a chance to put across your branding and product ethos, include more
keywords, and let your product shine. You can use it to show brand ambassadors,
or include emotive pictures that connect emotionally with your customer.

The quality and format of the content can make a huge difference.

### What is A/B testing?

A/B testing is when a product has two separate versions of content both selling
at the same time, to test which is more effective.

Using the A/B testing tool in Amazon’s Experiments Learning Center, Vendors and
Sellers can load two different versions of A+ content onto the same ASIN.

At the end of the experiment, which can run from four to 10 weeks, Amazon
provides sales data and predictive metrics, so you can see which was more
successful and which is more likely to be successful over the next year.

### Why do A/B testing?

e-Comas has had great success using the tool to test different types of content
on the same product, to see which one is converting best.

We do this for major FMCG brands, so they can also test the sensitivity of
certain topics for certain products: focusing on packaging (being
environmentally friendly) for instance, or on certain benefits (pack size).

It's worth running the test with significant, noticeable differences in the
content, because minor differences are less likely to affect the buyer.

It can also be used to test basic A+ against premium A+, to see whether premium
is worth the extra cost.

Once the test is done, the metrics provided will bring insights which can be
used on all sales channels backed by data.

### How can I access Experiments Learning Center?

It’s available only to high-traffic ASINs, to make sure there’s enough data at
the end of the experiment to provide meaningful results. You can access it via
Vendor Central or Seller Central.
