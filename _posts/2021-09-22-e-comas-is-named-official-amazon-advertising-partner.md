e-Comas is proud to announce it is now an approved member of the
[Amazon Advertising Partner Network](https://advertising.amazon.com/en-gb/blog/introducing-partner-network).

Launched earlier this year, the Partner Network is a source for brands
advertising on Amazon to find trusted agencies and tool providers.

It includes a
[directory](https://advertising.amazon.com/en-gb/resources/find-a-partner/managed-service-providers?ref_=a20m_us_fndprt_btn_msp)
for brands to search for ideal partners, like e-Comas.

As a Partner, e-Comas also benefits from an exclusive range of educational,
technical and marketing resources directly from Amazon.

e-Comas will use the direct support and training from Amazon to boost the
knowledge of its 45-strong team of ecommerce experts even further, which means
its customers advertising on Amazon will receive better support than ever
before.

With trusted partner status, and even greater insight and understanding of
Amazon Advertising, e-Comas is looking forward to offering an unrivalled level
of service to its clients.

“We believe strongly that advertising is one of the best and quickest ways to
boost traffic to your listings on Amazon and achieve conversion,” says Jérôme de
Guigné, CEO of e-Comas.

“It's extremely cost-effective, and we look forward to learning even more ways
we can help our clients achieve massive growth globally on Amazon.”
