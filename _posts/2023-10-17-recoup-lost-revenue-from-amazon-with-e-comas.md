Did you know that, as a Seller or Vendor, Amazon is likely to owe you money – money that you could be claiming back?

Up to 3% of your Amazon stock gets lost, damaged, destroyed or disposed of – and many sellers don't even know they can claim reimbursements for that stock.

There are dozens of different types of Amazon overbillings and deductions that you could be recouping.

The snag is that the processes for recouping lost revenue on Amazon are complex and time-consuming - and you only get so much time to do it. 

But don't stress: e-Comas and our specialist partners can help you through the process. Read on to find out how!

### How does Amazon revenue get lost?

As mentioned, quite a chunk of Amazon's billions of dollars worth of FBA stock, in thousands of warehouses all over the world, goes missing or gets destroyed.

It's estimated that 1-3% of all stock gets damaged in the warehouse, or lost in transit, or accidentally disposed of. Or customers receive a refund and never return the item. So your stock is lost, and Amazon owes you money.

Think: you’ve borne the cost of producing the item, it’s been lost or destroyed through no fault of yours, and without making the claim, you’re out of pocket. 

What's 3% of your annual revenue? Thousands – and you could get it all back. Amazon will reimburse you the retail price of each item that goes missing (minus fees).

Amazon gives you 18 months to make most claims (but only 90 days for some types of claim). That means, if you were to audit your account for potential reimbursements today, you’d probably see a large chunk of cash dating back over a year - but if you don’t claim it, it’s lost forever. 

What kind of charges can you recoup?

There are lots of types of claim you can make. Here are a few reasons to claim:

* The customer received a refund but never returned the item
* The customer was refunded more than the original charge
* The customer sent the wrong item back
* A product was returned but then damaged
* A product was lost, damaged or destroyed in the warehouse
* The seller was billed more than the initial order amount
* The seller was wrongfully charged for weight or dimension of inventory
* The carrier lost, damaged or destroyed the product during shipping.

### How our service works

e-Comas works with several partners that specialise in recouping these lost costs.

Our partners can even provide you with a dashboard to identify potential reimbursements you can make from Amazon, and easily file a claim.
