More than 100,000 businesses across the globe currently use Amazon Brand Registry – and, for those of you who sell on Amazon, it may be obvious why.

As Amazon has grown, becoming the premier eCommerce business platform in the world, protecting your brand from fraud needs to be one of your biggest priorities.

From third-party sellers changing the name of your products to competitors using your brand logo to sell their low-quality items, many things can go wrong if you're not careful.

Are you determined to protect your brand? Curious about the benefits of Amazon Brand Registry for your business? This blog explore how Amazon Brand Registry can protect your business and the added benefits of the service that will give your business a competitive edge. 

### What is Amazon Brand Registry?

First launched as a program to help protect your brand from counterfeit products, Amazon Brand Registry has evolved a couple of times since then. The service now offers a whole suite of services to bolster your brand, giving your business a competitive edge. 

More than 130,000 brands worldwide have registered for Amazon Brand Registration, and on average, they are reporting a remarkable 99% fewer suspected infringements than before the launch of Brand Registry.

The Amazon Brand Registry membership doesn't impose any fees. However, some related services, like the Transparency program, are not free. 

If you're not already a registered Brand Owner on Amazon, there are heaps of benefits that make the exclusive program worthwhile. 

### What are the benefits of Amazon Brand Registry?

#### 1. Protect your brand

Imagine you have invested blood, sweat, and tears into building a consistent brand that customers know and trust, for a third-party seller to come along and change details about your brand or products. Brand Registry can prevent this by giving you extra protection against other sellers.

Once your brand is registered, only you can control how your content appears. This prevents incorrect information from being spread, ensuring customers only see accurate content about your brand and products. After all, accurate product listings are crucial to happy customers.

#### 2. Access enhanced content features

With Brand Registry, you have a greater range of tools to promote your brand and products, including:

* A+ Content: With A+ content, you can add more text and images to your product listings. The ability to create visually rich content will do wonders for your conversion rates. 
* Amazon Brand Stores: A must-have for any brand, Stores is like having your own website on Amazon. It's a dedicated page that's customised and structured to show off all your products together.

#### 3. Get to know your customers

With Amazon Brand Analytics, you can get a clearer idea about who your customers are and what they're searching for. This gives you greater insight into where you should be focusing your marketing efforts.

#### 4. Advertise with Sponsored Brand Ads

Registering your brand also unlocks Sponsored Brand Ads. These adverts help you attract customers when they're at the searching stage. They appear in critical locations across Amazon - on the top of, alongside or within Amazon search results - to increase your chances of getting your brand and products seen.

### How to enrol in the Amazon Brand Registry

Are you interested in reaping the benefits of Brand Registry? If so, it's a straightforward process.

**Step 1: Make sure that you're eligible for Brand Registry.**

Not every store on Amazon can benefit from Brand Registry. Before you get started with Brand Registry, there are a couple of requirements to comply with.

For example, the first thing you need is a Trademark Registration or Serial Number. If that's something that your business doesn't currently have, you won't be able to proceed. 

Next, Amazon will want to know if your products come with any branded logos or packaging. Just as with a registered trademark number, the same rules apply: you won't qualify for the Amazon Brand Registry program if it's something you lack.

**Step 2: Create your Amazon Brand Registry account**

After meeting all of the requirements for Amazon’s Brand Registry program, it's time to set up your account. You can use your username and password credentials from your Amazon Seller account to sign into Brand Registry.

**Step 3: Enrol your brand**

You'll need to provide Amazon with to get started, including the brand identification, intellectual property, and account characteristics.

After providing Amazon with all of this information, all you have to do is click "Submit," and you're ready to go.

Here are some of the different types of attacks your Amazon Brand can face:
