#### The USA

American shoppers have the biggest choice of retail options in the world.
[According to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2017/05/31/why-the-amazon-effect-is-so-huge-in-the-usa-and-greater-than-in-other-countries/?sh=3f1fc7b1aaef),
the USA has 11 times the commercial retail space of Germany, and a whopping 400
times that of India.

These masses of malls have created a very competitive retail environment –
which, of course, Amazon and other online retailers have got to compete with
too. So if you're expanding into the USA, you need to prepare for cut-throat
competitiveness.

And not just in price: small details, including quality of delivery and
packaging, are important to Americans.

#### Germany

In Amazon's second-biggest marketplace globally, customers want the best quality
for the lowest price, say our German e-Comas experts. They spend a lot of time
reading and writing reviews, and they love price-comparison websites.

However, be careful with your communication: if something sounds too good to be
true, they'll get suspicious. They are likely to read the negative reviews, too.

“An absolute must for us: quick-and-easy easy transactions, expert advice and
fast troubleshooting across all channels,” says Jana, adding that one-day
delivery and one-day reply from customer service is becoming the norm.

Germans respond well to shorter text and logic-orientated content.

Lastly, the quality of the German translations has to be spot-on. “If the German
content has typos or sounds slightly non-native, they won't buy the product.”

#### The UK

It's a fairly small country but it's Amazon's third-biggest marketplace, and
that's because UK citizens are big online shoppers. It's estimated that over 90%
of the UK population have shopped on Amazon.

They're price-conscious: they'll look for the best deal and shop around among
different sellers on Amazon. They're not as review-hungry as the Germans – they
tend to scan through the first few only.

They're also less likely than other nations, such as India and the US, to
respond to emotive advertising, preferring fact-based information.

#### Japan

Amazon's fourth-largest global marketplace is Japan, where they care a lot about
little details and perfect execution.

One of our clients had an end customer in Japan who sent them a lengthy email,
with photos, about some extremely small stitches on their product that weren't
quite evenly-spaced.

Content localisation is the trickiest part of expanding into Japan. There are
three alphabets, and many different words for the same object, which makes
keyword research a bit more complex.

Product images often have a lot of text over the photo – although we hear that
some Japanese consumers like the fact that these can be less common on Amazon.

#### India

Average product ratings in India are lower than elsewhere. That's because the
consumers there don't hesitate to leave very bad reviews if things fall short of
their standards.

The Indians have a saying: “Cheap and best”, which is used primarily in street
shopping, but more and more they're realising that's not always true. However,
lower prices and discounts are very attractive, especially online. “We also want
the most use for money,” says Asha. “If a product warranty is one year, it
should last way more.”

Irrespective of category, ads for most products are designed to touch people
emotionally: mother-child relationships and other family and emotional bonds
have always worked really well in Indian adverts.

Finally, brand value is extremely important in India: once your brand is firmly
in a customer's mind – especially Gen X – they will continue to use and
recommend the product. They're more inclined to go with what has always worked
for them than to try new things.

#### France and Italy

The French and Italians tend to be methodical when buying online, and
price-conscious.

Presentation is key, and they place high value on trustworthiness of the brand
and product. Informative and reassuring product descriptions have the best
effect.

Unlike in Germany, in France leaving reviews isn't as common – and for those
that do, they tend not to be very detailed.

#### Spain

The Spanish are a little more spontaneous on their buying approach – they don't
put lots of time into researching the product and reading reviews.

They place value on the brand, and the product's social recognition, and
appreciate simple, clear sales copy.

**There are obviously many other nations and they all have their own quirks,
which are worth investigating before you expand. You can
