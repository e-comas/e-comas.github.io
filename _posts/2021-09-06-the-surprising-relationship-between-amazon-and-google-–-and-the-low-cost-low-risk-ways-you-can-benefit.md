#### Focused, targeted advertising

It's estimated that as much as a quarter of Amazon sellers now use Google to
advertise their products.

Google is a fantastic low-risk platform for advertisers.

An AdWords campaign converts into sales well because it's so focused: you can
directly target people who are looking for exactly the kind of product you sell.

It's great value, and offers an unbeatable return on investment:
[as much as 200%](https://landingcube.com/traffic/amazon-adwords/).

#### People Google Amazon - yes, really

People often search for products on Google even when they have every intention
of buying them on Amazon, says Brett Curry of OMG Commerce, speaking to
[Orange Klik in this webinar](https://youtu.be/U_dCNh0NrSw).

Including the term 'Amazon' in their search – for example “bedsheets on Amazon”
or “Amazon bedsheets” - “happens millions of times every single day,” says
Brett, and it results in an extremely high click-through rate to Amazon pages.

Even without including 'Amazon' in the search term, Amazon results still get a
very high click-through rate – up to 15%, says Brett. (Watch the whole webinar,
it's brilliant).

#### Are your competitors stealing clicks?

There are a couple of other things to consider.

We've all Googled a brand and found one of their competitors comes up in the ads
for that search. Your own competitors might well be using your name in AdWords
to steal clicks when people Google your products, so it's worth advertising just
to beat them to those clicks.

Brett Curry also believes that it's easier to beat your competitors to clicks on
Google than on Amazon.

If someone searches your product on Amazon, all your competition is there for
them to browse on the results page, complete with listings and images.

On Google, if they find you on AdWords, they're less likely to notice other
brands that come up in that search.

#### The best place to start

We've talked a lot recently about the
[different ways you can advertise using Amazon itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5OyWCkLtFE&list=PLIISXNQzZ8Zr98Hm9kmymGy9sQTdsiu-9).

But it's well worth looking at other digital advertising platforms and social
media to drive traffic to your Amazon listings, and Google is probably the best
place to start.

It can improve your rankings as well as boosting your sales too, and it's a very
low-cost, low-risk advertising option.

Guess who Google’s biggest advertising client is?

They may be rivals, but #Amazon and #Google have a very fruitful relationship,
and if you want to get outside traffic for your products on Amazon, Google is
probably the best place to start.
