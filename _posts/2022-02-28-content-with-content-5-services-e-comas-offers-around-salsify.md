Salsify is a magnificent platform.
In the rapidly-growing eCommerce world, the services it provides quickly become essential: one place for all your product content, meaning it's consistent across all the platforms you sell your products on.
That gives you a professional, omnichannel strategy aligned on all platforms, and it also saves you a lot of time.
As a major eCommerce agency, e-Comas works very closely with Salsify. We have great working relationships with their team, talking to them daily and learning about new Salsify updates as they happen. Their product content expertise, combined with our eCommerce strategy, operations and traffic know-how, make an unstoppable combination.

What is Salsify?
It's a multi-faceted tool that can do many wonderful things, but put simply, Salsify is a product experience management (PXM) tool that allows you to upload all your product content into one place, then push it out easily to where ever it's needed – on multiple Amazon marketplaces, for example, or to different distribution channels.
Think of massive brands that sell their products on many different stores, online and offline: the imagery, branding and wording for their products is always consistent wherever the product is being sold, and that creates a super-strong brand: consistent, professional, and trustworthy.
In today's eCommerce environment, customers are used to shopping around. They'll check out your product on Amazon, on your own website and often in store, too. They'll Google it and, within seconds, compare prices across multiple sites.
When they do that, you want all the listings they see to offer the same information: the same imagery, the same wording. If some listings have out-of-date photos, logos and text, your brand looks less professional. Salsify combats that by allowing you to centralise your product information and push it out to all your endpoints at once.
Aside from that, using a PXM tool like Salsify saves any growing business a huge amount of time and staff power in uploading and managing content – and there's lots more you can do with it.

So what services does e-Comas offer around Salsify?
We work with customers all the way through their journey with Salsify, from the onboarding call onwards.
Here's more information on the main services we offer:

1: The implementation service
Salsify likes us to help customers implement Salsify, because we have the eCommerce knowledge and experience. We know Salsify inside out, but we also know our customers, and we can tailor the implementation to them, to make sure they're getting the best out of Salsify.
We guide you through the onboarding process, helping you structure your data and set up everything you need to within Salsify.
The first thing we propose to customers is always to centralise all their content within Salsify, including all digital assets.
This is the major benefit of Salsify: having all your content in one place, and being able to publish content to Amazon, Shopify and all other eCommerce platforms you use, much more quickly than if your team were doing it manually.
Instead of having all your content in different places, on different tools, you have it on one single tool, worldwide. Salsify will be your one point of data, your one true source of content.

2: Consultancy services
Implementation takes two to six months. After that, we hand you over to your Customer Success Manager (CSM) at Salsify, who we work with throughout the implementation process to make sure it goes smoothly, and they become your main point of contact.
However, sometimes after implementation customers have issues that we are better placed to deal with than our colleagues at Salsify. Problems at the Amazon end, for example, like when a customer recently needed help with updating their channel mapping between Salsify and Amazon Vendor Central because of a new API.
For this reason, we now offer various consultancy services for customers using Salsify, providing a useful link between the content at Salsify and the endpoints at which it appears.
These include working out pinch points for our customers, and how to improve syndication processes for them.

3: Syndication help
We can help customers use Salsify for syndication – that is, pushing out their product information to various endpoints, such as their Amazon marketplaces, Shopify, CDiscount, Veepee, Walmart, etc.
For each of these endpoints, the e-Comas team can help you set up a channel within Salsify and configure the content in the format the retailer requires.
Amazon A+ content, for example, can look however the seller wants it to look, but that means it can be really complex to set up. We can do it for you, no problem.

4: Account management
Salsify saves our customers so much time – but time is still needed to upload and update content or channel mapping regarding the latest retailer requirements.
We offer full account management: our team of experts can help you manage your day-to-day business activities on Salsify.

5: Listings classification
Amazon regularly cleans up its listing categories and subcategories. Usually this happens unnoticed in the background, but occasionally they will classify a product with an irrelevant category.
With this new service, we will look at your products, highlight any wrongly classified categories, and suggest accurate, logical ones.
This can boost your Amazon rankings and your advertising success, as well as making search results more accurate, and helping your products get seen by more people.
