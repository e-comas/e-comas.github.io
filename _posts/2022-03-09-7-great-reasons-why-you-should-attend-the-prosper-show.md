Las Vegas is the place to be next week (14-16 March) as the Prosper Show lands: one of the biggest and best eCommerce shows in the world.

Here are our reasons why you should drop everything next week and come with us.

### It's Amazon-specific – for established Amazon sellers.

Prosper is aimed at established Amazon sellers who want to boost their business.

This specific target audience, plus the show's educational ethos and focus on best practice, make it a high quality show with incredibly useful content.

It's not a show for beginners: there's a level of assumed knowledge which means you're unlikely to waste your time trying to cut through the basic or irrelevant stuff.

### It has a focus on expansion.

That's omnichannel expansion as well as international expansion.

Many of the speakers, panels and events are geared towards helping established Amazon sellers grow their business outwards, and that includes workshops and talks on the likes of Walmart, D2C sales, and even brick-and-mortar retail.

It also includes global expansion, and that's where we come in...

### Our MD Jérôme de Guigné is speaking!

The great man has his own speaker session at 1:45pm on 15th: 'Expand Globally on Amazon in Europe and Beyond'.

He'll be laying down e-Comas's well-proven strategy for expanding Amazon sales globally out of North America, starting with Europe, then Asia and the Middle East.

As well as a practical framework for global expansion, he'll give a list of dos and don'ts, and examples from real case studies. [Details here](https://prospershow.com/conference/agenda/#expand-globally-on-amazon-in-europe-and-beyond) – please go along and watch our eCommerce rockstar in action, he loves a crowd.

### Our friends are speaking too.

Shout out to our gifted eCommerce friends!

Liz Downing from Teikametrics, Jana Krekic from YLT Translations, Yoni Mazor from Getida, Carina McLeod from eCommerceNurse, and Lazar Žepinić from Sellers Alley all have speaker sessions too, among many other legendary eCommerce experts. We're proud to work with these guys. Check out [the conference agenda here](https://prospershow.com/conference/agenda/).

### It's a chance to make contacts across the Atlantic.

Jérôme will be talking about how American sellers can expand into Europe – but the show is also a great chance for European sellers to learn how to expand stateside.

As well as all the conference speakers, there are over 150 exhibitors to learn from. Including us! [We're on stand 333](https://prosper.a2zinc.net/Prosper2022/Public/eBooth.aspx?IndexInList=33&FromPage=Exhibitors.aspx&ParentBoothID=&ListByBooth=true&BoothID=1364876) – come and say hello to our lovely team.

### It's great for networking.

Within the show there are [several special events](https://prospershow.com/events-activations/) designed for networking.

There's the Prosper Social, a poolside event the night before the show starts. A networking reception in the evening of the first day. Think Tank Workshops, a peer-to-peer opportunity to share best practice with other sellers. And Seller Tips and Tricks, where sellers get on stage for a couple of minutes to tell people about a cool Amazon hack they use.

And that brings us to...

### The after party!

Prosper's party schedule is as legendary (and as useful for making deals) as the conference programme itself. We'll be at the #AlwaysOn after party (sponsored by our friends YLT Translations and Teikametrics).

A chance to party in Vegas with our eCommerce friends? See you there!
