Localisation of pictures is finally available to Sellers as well as Vendors, and it's a game changer for Account Managers.

Last year Amazon finally released a new tool to allow Amazon Vendors to localise their pictures on listings. The 'country specific upload' tool lets you choose different images for different countries – hugely useful for targeting your content to different markets.

Previously, your images for an ASIN would appear on every listing under that ASIN worldwide, which could be disastrous for, say, a Japanese Vendor with text-heavy images trying to sell their products in Europe.

Sorting out images was a massive headache, involving weeks of talking to Amazon. Country Specific Upload shortened that process down to the time it takes to click a few buttons.

Rolled out to Vendors first, Amazon has now made it available for Sellers, too.

### How did localisation work in the past?

Previously, all images uploaded to a single ASIN were displayed globally by default.

If you wanted to localise your pictures – for example, upload images that contain native language – you had to open a case with Amazon through each of your accounts or markets. You had to add a zip folder containing the images to upload, and be precise on which marketplace you would like these images to be displayed.

It could take ages. One e-Comas customer wanted localised pictures across 45 ASINs in two marketplaces: it required the e-Comas team to open 74 cases with Amazon, with daily follow-up on each one.

### What's changed about the process?

The Country Specific Upload self-service tool allows you to do it in a couple of clicks, without any back-and-forth with Amazon.

It's great news for all brands and account managers. It has already saved us hours of time with our Vendor customers, and now it's making a difference with Sellers, too.

### Why should I localise pictures, anyway?

We're big fans of localisation because we think it makes a real impact on your conversion rates: good content = good conversion.

Localised content means plenty of relevant images, strong keywords in the right language, and accurately-translated text that appeals to the audience. That gives you the best chance of wowwing your customers and converting into sales.

Conversion is affected by bad translations; customers are less likely to trust the Seller and therefore buy the product if they can tell the content wasn't written by a native. We recommend using a professional translations service: our friends at [YLT Translations](https://ylt-translations.com/) are the best.

What we like about the Country Specific Upload tool - apart from the work it saves us - is that it gives us the time and scope to create graphic design in different languages for our clients.
