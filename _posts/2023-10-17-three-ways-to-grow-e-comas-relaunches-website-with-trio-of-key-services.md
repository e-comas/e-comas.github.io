We're excited to announce that e-Comas's website has a [fresh new look](https://e-comas.com/)!

The new site fulfils our mission to “make eCommerce simple” by highlighting the three major facets of our work as an eCommerce services agency: [Global Expansion](https://e-comas.com/global-expansion.html), [Retail Media](https://e-comas.com/retail-media.html), and [Data & Technology](https://e-comas.com/data-and-tech.html).

Under these three banners, we create strategies that help our clients thrive on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/), [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/), [Bol](https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/) and other online marketplaces, globally. Our new website will help clients hone in on the services they need from us.

The revamp comes as e-Comas celebrates its 10-year anniversary.

### 10 years of skyrocketing success

[Back in 2013](https://e-comas.com/about-us.html) the agency was called The Great Wall, founded by Jérôme de Guigné with the aim of helping major brands thrive on Amazon in particular.

A rebrand to e-Comas came in 2019, and now e-Comas is one of the most respected eCommerce agencies in the world, helping dozens of big-name brands skyrocket their success across global online marketplaces.

Jérôme says: “I'm incredibly proud of how far we've come in the last 10 years, and what my team have achieved in that time. I'm humbled by the fact that the 'e-Comets' include some of the finest professionals working in eCommerce today.

“This dynamic new website is symbolic of the next stage in our journey. We're really pushing these three components of our business because our clients usually come to us with one of these three goals in mind.

“By zoning the site this way, we can help guide potential and existing clients to exactly the services they need, and give them a good idea of the strategy we'll use to help them thrive.”

### Zone 1: Global Expansion

e-Comas's raison d'etre is to help brands grow – preferably all over the world.

Lots of brands want to establish a strong eCommerce presence and grow in their home market, but we're ambitious: there's no reason our clients can't rapidly expand into foreign markets as well.

We work in all Amazon marketplaces, helping brands expand their business all over Europe, the US, Asia and the rest of the world. We also work on more local marketplaces like [CDiscount](https://www.cdiscount.com/) and Bol, and specialise in [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) for our clients' own web shops.

We've got a large, international team, and between us we speak 15+ native languages. We can help brands localise their content, learn the shopping culture of the marketplaces they're targeting, and deal with local tax and legal requirements.

### Zone 2: Retail Media

Retail media is the art of selling and advertising online to maximise conversion across the shopper's journey.

It encompasses selling on Amazon and other marketplaces, and it's effective because it allows greater access to data and metrics than any kind of advertising that ever came before it.

As a verified Amazon Ads partner and an AMC and Google Ads-certified agency, we specialise in omnichannel campaigns to maximise our clients' profitability.

Our team are used to handling massive advertising budgets and applying our up-to-the-minute eCommerce knowledge to deliver the most efficient campaigns for our clients. We can leverage social media and search advertising as well as marketplace advertising to make sure our clients are getting traffic to their products, and the traffic converts.

### Zone 3: Data Technology

e-Comas is currently working to become the [most data-driven eCommerce agency in the world](https://e-comas.com/2023/10/17/how-ecomas-is-becoming-the-most-data-driven-agency-in-the-world.html).

The team is undertaking extensive data and analytics training to ensure we can help our clients maximise their selling potential using the wealth of data provided by Amazon and other platforms. We can perform market intelligence insights, advanced forecasting and data strategy for our clients, all communicated clearly and coherently.

We also offer our own reporting tool, Compas, which collates all your sales, advertising, and product information in a single place. With Compas you can easily view the big picture of your business, any time.

The website now has a [client login](https://e-comas.com/clientlogin.html) button where our clients can access their Compas dashboard.

We can also offer training to our clients' teams, ensuring they have the skills and knowledge to use the data independently.

### Everything you need to sell online

The website also serves as a directory for all our other eCommerce services, such as content syndication (helping clients manage their product experience across the digital shelf, in partnership with [Salsify](https://www.salsify.com/)), and website creation (specialising in webstores, in partnership with [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/)).

On the [Partners](https://e-comas.com/partners.html) page you can find details of all the partners we work with, offering every eCommerce service from revenue recovery and compliance management, to operations streamlining and content translation.

Our extensive partner network means we can put you in touch with every single eCommerce service you'll ever need.

Finally, our Resources page is a hub of useful information for online retailers. We love sharing our knowledge with the industry via our published [blogs](https://e-comas.com/news.html), [white papers](https://e-comas.com/white-paper-form.html), [webinars](https://e-comas.com/webinar.html) and [podcasts](https://e-comas.com/podcast.html).

And across the site, visitors can get a good idea of our missions and values, as well as reading [case studies](https://e-comas.com/case-studies.html) from our clients.

Jérôme says: “As a boutique agency, we're very proud to be able to offer big brands every service they need to grow their business online. We hope potential clients and old friends will enjoy browsing the new site and utilising our team's vast knowledge and experience. I can't think of a better marker for 10 fantastic years in business.”
