Amazon is the largest online retailer globally. In the 28 years since its creation, it has become the top eCommerce platform globally and shows no sign of waning.

With over 350 million products sold on Amazon, it is hard to believe it began as a small online bookstore.

There are currently 9.5 million Amazon sellers globally, and because of this, there is a lot of competition. For this reason, many sellers utilise off-channel traffic sources such as paid search like Google, social, and email to drive traffic to their product in the Amazon Marketplace.

However, once the potential customer clicked the link in the ad and entered the Amazon database, there was no way of knowing whether they followed through and bought the product.

That is until Amazon Attribution arrived on the eCommerce scene.

### What is Amazon Attribution?

In a nutshell, Amazon Attribution is a form of Amazon Advertising that functions as a measurement and analytics tool.

Before Amazon Attribution, analysing buyer metrics was impossible. Now sellers can track traffic and revenue from third-party channels, such as Google, social media, and email. 

What is the purpose of Amazon Attribution?

As the name suggests, Amazon Attribution allows you to attribute sales to your off-Amazon marketing finally.

Amazon Attribution is a real game-changer because this data allows you to track customers throughout the entire sales funnel.

### Why should you use Amazon Attribution?

Amazon Attribution could be transformational for its users. Marketers will be able to see precisely where each sale comes from.

Amazon Attribution allows sellers to see precisely which adverts drive the most sales and provide the highest ROI; they can then optimise the ads that work and remove those that don’t. This will drive more sales and make you more money in the long term.

The insights from Amazon Attribution can also help you learn more about your customers and understand them much better. For instance, you may discover that customers prefer one product over another. You will then be able to make the necessary changes using this information.

### What metrics are tracked?

Amazon Attribution gives you insight into the following:

* Click-throughs
* Detailed page views
* Add To Carts
* Purchases
* Units Sold
* New to Brand Customers

Who can use Amazon Attribution?

Amazon Attribution is currently only available for professional sellers enrolled in Amazon Brand Registry.

Eligible sellers can access Amazon Attribution measurements through the self-service console or tool providers integrated with the Amazon Ads API.

### How do you get started with Amazon Attribution?

The first step to getting started with Amazon Attribution is filling out the signup form and logging in to your account.

Once your account has been approved, you can start matching products to the campaigns you’re tracking. 

You will be given Attribution Tags, which are links to your product. You simply place that link in your ad, blog post, email, or whatever it may be. Amazon will then be able to track their interactions.

This may sound complicated; it is very straightforward. There is plenty of support available should you need it, not least from the eCommerce experts at e-Comas..
