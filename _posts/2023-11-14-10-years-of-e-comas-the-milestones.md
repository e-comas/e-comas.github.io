Here at e-Comas we're celebrating 10 glorious years of helping retailers thrive and grow on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) and other eCommerce platforms.

We're incredibly proud of what we've achieved in that time. So permit us to take your hand and show you some of the milestones over the years.

### Building 'the Wall'

Our story begins in 2013. Our founder [Jérôme de Guigne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeromedeguigneamazonexpert/), working in distribution for a major camera equipment supplier, had, over the last few years, got really good at selling on Amazon. He decided to go it alone and set up an agency to help other brands succeed on Amazon too.

He called it The Great Wall, suggesting scale, longevity and visibility for his clients, and based it in Luxembourg, the business capital of Europe and European HQ of Amazon itself.

For the first couple of years he acted as a one-man consultancy, slowly building his knowledge and power.

Then in 2017, things started to snowball.

### A natural thought leader

That year he achieved his first five big clients, and also started taking on more employees. The business now consisted of five Amazon experts, and was starting to grow its social media following.

Jérôme started publishing the blogs that have established him as a thought leader in eCommerce. [This is the first one](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blessed-small-brands-shall-sell-amazon-j%25C3%25A9r%25C3%25B4me-de-guign%25C3%25A9/?trackingId=GvyIOqDWRV%2Bw%2FDMEA4ahaA%3D%3D) – budding Amazon sellers can still learn a lot from it to this day!

### Fame at last

2019 was a big year, as the business won its first household-name client: Michelin.

The world-famous tyres-and-guidebooks brand chose e-Comas to help sort out the rights issues it was having with distributors on Amazon, leading to a long and successful partnership – and the extra kudos that comes with working for such a big brand.

2019 was also the year we achieved 10 clients, and we opened our first office abroad, in Madagascar. This was also the year Jérôme started speaking at events, hosting packed seminars at [Amafest](https://amafestuk.com/) and [White Label Expo](https://www.whitelabelexpo.co.uk/).

Shortly afterwards we hit the milestone of 10 employees, and in 2020 we opened our third office, in India.

### Now is the winter of our content

Also in 2020, we started our hugely successful [webinar](https://e-comas.com/webinar.html) programme, which gave people something to watch and learn from with a glass of wine during those long lockdown evenings.

We also ramped up our other content creation, publishing dozens of [blogs](https://e-comas.com/news.html), videos and [white papers](https://e-comas.com/white-paper-form.html) – and then launching a [podcast](https://e-comas.com/podcast.html) – all with the aim of helping brands develop confidence and knowledge in selling online.

In 2021 we opened our US office, which officially puts us on four continents, and set up dedicated [Retail Media](https://e-comas.com/retail-media.html) and [DSP](https://advertising.amazon.com/en-gb/solutions/products/amazon-dsp) teams to take care of clients' Amazon advertising needs.

### Which brings us to now

Since then e-Comas has grown faster than ever. We now have 50 employees, up from 10 in 2019; and we now speak more than 25 languages between us, up from five in 2019.

We've attended dozens of industry shows, making new contacts, talking to old friends, and sharing our wisdom as speakers.

A career highlight for Jérôme was speaking at [Amazon Accelerate](https://sell.amazon.com/events) in Seattle in September 2022, sharing his expertise in going global on Amazon.

We've become experts in data, first setting up [Amazon Marketing Cloud](https://e-comas.com/2022/10/31/amazon-marketing-cloud-the-holy-grail-of-advertising.html) (AMC) reporting for our clients, then [training all our employees in data literacy](https://e-comas.com/2023/10/17/how-ecomas-is-becoming-the-most-data-driven-agency-in-the-world.html) to make sure we can help our clients make the most of all the data they get from their seller accounts.

And did you see our recent news – [Jérôme is now officially an Amazon Ads Ambassador](https://e-comas.com/2023/10/31/new-ads-products-and-our-very-own-ambassador-everything-we-learned-at-unboxed-23.html), one of seven thought leaders chosen for their dedication to helping brands sell on Amazon.

Finally, having previously been unashamedly an Amazon-focused eCommerce agency, in the last couple of years we've ramped up our expertise on other platforms, including [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/), [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/), [Bol](https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/), [CDiscount](https://www.cdiscount.com/) and more.

### Pride in the e-Comets

Jérôme says: “It's incredible to look back on 10 years and see how far we've come.

“We couldn't have achieved this without all the great e-Comets who have joined over the years - this has always been a major blessing.

“We've skyrocketed brands on eCommerce platforms all over the globe, and we're going to get even better at doing that, as we all expand our expertise across all online retailers, and strive to become the most data-centric eCommerce agency in the world. Here's to the next 10 years!”
