e-Comas CEO Jérôme de Guigné is writing for Forbes!

The e-Commerce expert and founder of our business is now a member of Forbes Business Council, meaning he can publish articles sharing his industry knowledge on [Forbes.com](http://forbes.com) – one of the world's most prestigious magazine brands.

And Forbes has just published his first full article.

It's about the EU's VAT One-Stop Shop – exploring how this new portal, introduced last year, can actually help small businesses selling on eCommerce in Europe, by making VAT requirements simpler and disincentivising unscrupulous players. [You can read it here.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/06/09/utilizing-the-benefits-of-the-eus-vat-one-stop-shop/?sh=1fc71a1876e2)

### Useful business advice

Articles submitted through [Forbes Councils](http://forbescouncils.com) are carefully selected and edited. Forbes, based in the US and famous worldwide for its top-notch business journalism and compelling rich lists, only publishes unique content with value for readers.

As well as his first full article, Jérôme has also contributed to three of Forbes' Expert Panel features: 

* [15 Smart Practices For Improving Your Current Digital Efforts](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/05/25/15-smart-practices-for-improving-your-current-digital-efforts/?sh=3162eb7b43fd)
* [Want To Be Seen As An Industry Expert? Try These 15 Strategies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/05/27/want-to-be-seen-as-an-industry-expert-try-these-15-strategies/?sh=7da325375d12)
* [14 Specific Actions For Creating Or Improving Your Product Expansion Strategy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/05/31/14-specific-actions-for-creating-or-improving-your-product-expansion-strategy/?sh=13623f7c35a4).

These articles put together valuable business advice from several members of Forbes Business Council, creating highly-readable articles for small business leaders.

### Experts invited

Forbes Councils membership is invitation-only, extended to experts with real insight and wisdom to share with peers. Jérôme was vetted and selected by a review committee based on his wide experience and and his track record of successfully impacting business growth metrics.

He will benefit from new networking opportunities, including a private forum in Forbes Business Council and invitations to member-only events.

He also has a very nice [profile on Forbes.com](https://profiles.forbes.com/u/d139bcfc-f77c-43fe-bd6f-3db5f2f23543), with links to all his articles.

### 'We share our knowledge'

Jérôme says: “It's an honour to be invited to join Forbes Business Council, which brings a lot of opportunity for e-Comas in terms of networking, and gives us lots of prestige. I have to say, it feels good to say I write for Forbes.

“At e-Comas our first purpose is to help our clients grow fast and globally on eCommerce, but we have a secondary purpose, to share our knowledge with others. Our team put a lot of hard work and time into creating useful blogs, vlogs, webinars and podcasts about eCommerce.

“Forbes membership gives us a new channel to share in-depth articles, and of course it's a promotional tool, but it's also a new way for us to share what we know with the wider eCommerce world.

“I hope my article on OSS will be useful for all our friends in the eCommerce industry, and I'm excited to grow our audience for everything we do at e-Comas.”
