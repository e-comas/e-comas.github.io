e-Comas is now an Amazon Ads Verified Partner – which makes us part of the Amazon Ads elite.

It's a promotion from our existing status as Amazon Ads Partner, gained last year. In Amazon's words, Verified Partners earn their status by “demonstrating expertise” and “delivering results for advertisers.”

### Extra prestige

The prestigious status gives us extra benefits that we can use to serve our clients, including access to Amazon beta programmes, and tailored training on campaign strategies and new product releases.

It means we're eligible to take part in the Amazon Ads Partner Awards, and it also gives us an enhanced listing in the [Amazon Ads Partner Directory](https://advertising.amazon.com/partners/directory/details/amzn1.ads1.ma1.cj3vydv54i8qcb80mhstj0em0//).

Best of all, it shows our clients and prospective clients that we have the skills and experience to help them build successful advertising campaigns on Amazon – and that Amazon itself recognises us as a trustworthy agency.

The next stage is to become an Advanced Partner, which we're excited to achieve.

### Why we love Amazon Ads

The Amazon Ads Partner Network, launched last year, consists of agencies, tool providers and other advertising support businesses. e-Comas [joined the Partner Network in 2021](https://e-comas.com/2021/09/22/e-comas-is-named-official-amazon-advertising-partner.html), and we're delighted to have been verified so quickly.

CEO and founder Jérôme de Guigné says: “It's great to be a Verified Partner of Amazon Ads. Our team has worked hard with our clients for years to deliver effective and stunning advertising that measurably grows their business.

“We love Amazon Ads because you can easily see and measure its success. There are lots of diverse and ingenious ways to advertise, from simple PPC through to more complex programmatic (DSP) advertising. We have experts in all of them, so our clients are in great hands. We're very happy that Amazon has recognised that and given us this extra prestige.”

### The quickest way to grow

The e-Comas team is made up of ex-Amazonians and brand managers, including several advertising specialists.

Our view is that the quickest way to grow on Amazon is to advertise, and the platform offers some of the best and most cost-efficient advertising methods in all media.

From the classic pay-per-click model, to the exciting potential of the DSP empire, Amazon's advertising is innovative, effective and lucrative for brands. We've used it many times to boost our clients' business, with stunning success.
