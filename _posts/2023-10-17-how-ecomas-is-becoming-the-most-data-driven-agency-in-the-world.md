In eCommerce, data is the key to modern business success.

The more data you have, the more intimately you can get to know your business, your sales and your customers.

That's why e-Comas is striving to become the most data-driven eCommerce agency in the world.

### Wow, that sounds big! Tell us more...

We want to be able to help our clients leverage the masses of data available from their marketplace accounts to boost their sales, streamline their advertising and become the best in their categories.

To do this, we are delivering enhanced data literacy training to our entire team.

Led by our Head of Analytics and in-house data guru Claudiu Clement, the agency is training the team in data literacy and analytics.

That means most of our team – more than 30 of us, at the last count – are able and certified to analyse our clients' anonymised sales data and help them make the most informed decisions possible.

### What does the training cover?

The training so far, delivered in hourly sessions, has covered data concepts and tools, how to apply data literacy in practice, and communicating findings clearly to our customers.

Our data-literate team are able to understand basic data concepts, interpret data, and apply critical thinking and scepticism. They are also continuously learning new methods and technologies.

Claudiu is leading the training thanks to his formidable data skills and know-how. He has a PhD in statistics, and has always loved working with data.

He says: “Leading this project lets me share my excitement and knowledge about data with our team. This way, we can all use data to help our clients succeed.”

Thanks to Clau, over 30 of our team can now understand data concepts, interpret data visualisations, perform data analysis and leverage Amazon reports.

### So what makes data so important in eCommerce?

It's important because eCommerce platforms are making more data available, and being able to use this data makes a seller's business more competitive.

By utilising this data, brands selling on Amazon, for example, can choose the best placements and keywords for their adverts, control their budgets better, and improve their conversion rates.

Just look at [Amazon Marketing Cloud](https://e-comas.com/2022/10/31/amazon-marketing-cloud-the-holy-grail-of-advertising.html) (AMC), Amazon's data platform that allows brands to precisely target potential buyers at every stage of the marketing funnel. It provides anonymised, aggregated data about your sales and customers, showing, for example, how many clicks and impressions went into a sale.

In the crowded Amazon marketplace, being able to understand and utilise this data is what will make certain retailers more competitive.

By becoming a data-literate agency, at e-Comas we can help our clients dominate on Amazon and other marketplaces.

As Clau says: “Data is a very useful tool for sellers on Amazon. It helps them understand market trends, how customers behave, and how well their products are doing.

“By looking at the data, sellers can adjust their prices, improve their product listings, and decide where to spend on advertising to increase sales and earn more.”

### Will there be more data training for the e-Comas team?

Yes, this training is just the start. Clau plans to create more training sessions to build on our basic data literacy, based on the needs of the team.

We'll also keep track of new data updates within Amazon and other marketplaces, so we're always at the forefront of data use and analytics to help our clients.

Jérôme de Guigné, founder and CEO of e-Comas, says: “I couldn't be prouder of Claudiu and the way he's seized this opportunity to enhance our amazing team. The training he's produced is world-class, and it's fantastic to see how enthusiastically the 'e-Comets' have taken it on.

“We already have 30 people certified to manage and use data for the benefit of our clients, many of which are international brands. For them, being the best in their category is essential. We're delighted that we'll be able to help them leverage the reams of data available to them, now and far into the future.”
